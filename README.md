# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @kourtneyhuget/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@kourtneyhuget/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

- `function1(AssertEqualTest)`: comparing two strings
- `function2(eqArrays)`: comparing arrays
- `function3(head)`: returns the first element in the array
- `function4(middle)`: returns the middle elements of an array (1 if off, 2 if even)
- `function5(tail)`: returns the last element in an array
- `function6(head)`: removes the first head of an array
